This is the source code for the pixel editor app tutorial series on PhotoGabble.

## Part One
_Published Jan 21st 2015_: [Tutorial](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/blog/tutorials/writing-a-pixel-editor-in-javascript-p1/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pixel_editor_tutorial_readme) | [Code](https://github.com/photogabble/pixel-editor-tutorial/tree/master/step%20one)

In this, the first part, we set up the application loop and complete writing functionality to understand mouse input on the canvas.

## Part Two
_Published Jan 28th 2015_: [Tutorial](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/blog/tutorials/writing-a-pixel-editor-in-javascript-p2/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pixel_editor_tutorial_readme) | [Code](https://github.com/photogabble/pixel-editor-tutorial/tree/master/step%20two)

In part two we build the data structure for a 16x16 image with 1bit colour depth and complete by having a canvas that we can draw on.

## Part Three
_Published Feb 4th 2015_: [Tutorial](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/blog/tutorials/writing-a-pixel-editor-in-javascript-p3/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pixel_editor_tutorial_readme) | [Code](https://github.com/photogabble/pixel-editor-tutorial/tree/master/step%20three)

In part three we build the 16x16 live preview so that you can see how your picture looks at its native resolution.

## Part Four
_Published May 8th 2015_: [Tutorial](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/blog/tutorials/writing-a-pixel-editor-in-javascript-p4/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pixel_editor_tutorial_readme) | [Code](https://github.com/photogabble/pixel-editor-tutorial/tree/master/step%20four)

In part four we expand the images data structure to expand the colour depth and add a colour swatch interface for selecting colours.

## Part Five
_Unpublished_: Tutorial | Code

In part five we work on saving the image as a png and begin refactoring the code to keep things tidy.

## Part Six
_Unpublished_: Tutorial | Code

In part six we write a simple PHP backend that is able to consume the image data structure as a string and store to a public library the png. We also write the functionality into our javascript app to be able to load from the public library.
